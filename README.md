# Outwork - My plans for this project

TLDR: Flutter/Firebase/Node.js Workout app for creating exercises/workouts, viewing upcoming workouts. Includes ability to upload photo/video to share your unique exercise with other users.

Set up: cd into function folder. npm run dev will spin up the node.js backend. runs on local host 3000

I intend to create an app where friends can motivate each other to exercise by building shareable workout 'decks'. These 'decks' are full workouts created and uniquely crafted by a user using exercise 'cards'. Each user can build and name their own decks which are then shareable amongst friends (or possibly anyone using the app). Other users can copy any deck they would like to try. 

In addition to decks, each user has a schedule where they can play specific decks for specific days. A weekly schedule pop-up should be the first view available to the user. Only friends who you have accepted can view (maybe, at some point, there could be a public/private field for profiles) your schedule. 

I believe there should be some other aspect of social motivation. Some ideas:

- Social media-like page to post workout pictures/meals.
- Some fun way to encourage friends to keep working out.
- Maybe users should be able to create their own workout cards? (However, this brings issues with moderating video/pictures/text)

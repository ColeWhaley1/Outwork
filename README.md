# Outwork

## TLDR 
Flutter/Firebase/Node.js Workout app for creating exercises/workouts, viewing upcoming workouts. Includes ability to upload photo/video to share your unique exercise with other users.

## Set Up
cd into function folder. npm run dev will spin up the node.js backend. runs on local host 3000

## Description/Goals
I intend to create an app where friends can motivate each other to exercise by creating and sharing their workouts. Each user can build and name their own workouts which are then shareable amongst friends (or possibly anyone using the app). Other users can copy any workouts they would like to try. 

In addition to workouts, each user has a schedule where they can set specific workouts for specific days. A weekly schedule pop-up should be the first view available to the user. Only friends you have accepted can view (maybe, at some point, there could be a public/private field for profiles) your schedule. 

I believe there should be some other aspect of social motivation. Some ideas:

- Social media-like page to post workout pictures/meals.
- Some fun way to encourage friends to keep working out.
- Maybe users should be able to create their own workout cards? (However, this brings issues with moderating video/pictures/text)


P.S. Some ideas here may not yet be implemented. These are my goals for the app.
